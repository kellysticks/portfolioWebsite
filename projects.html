                    <h2>Hey, I'm Kelly</h2>
                    <h3>Just the Highlights</h3>
                    <p class="white-box">I am an enthusiastic and dynamic front-end developer with an insatiable appetite for learning. I pride myself on being a lifelong learner, dedicating myself to mastering a craft or concept before diving into the next one. My project experience spans across a spectrum of technologies, including HTML/CSS, JavaScript, React, and Salesforce front-end programming modal, Lightning Web Components (LWC). My commitment to staying at the forefront of web development trends ensures that I can consistently deliver innovative and efficient solutions. I'm excited to contribute my skills and passion to your team, driving forward the success of our projects and the overall user experience.

                        I embarked on my professional journey in Technology Consulting, where I initially served as a Scrum Master and Functional Analyst. My responsibilities encompassed various critical aspects, including facilitating grooming sessions, developing user stories, establishing acceptance criteria, and overseeing Scrum teams. It was during this period that I discovered my true passion lay in hands-on development rather than just supervising it. This revelation prompted me to dedicate the subsequent three years of my career to mastering the intricate technical aspects of the SaaS/PaaS Salesforce platform.
                        I pursued multiple certifications and transitioned into the role of a Salesforce System Administrator. This role allowed me to gain a profound understanding of Salesforce, but I soon realized that I aspired to further enhance my technical capabilities and become a full-fledged Front-End Web Developer. Leveraging my expertise in Salesforce and experience in delivering Salesforce implementations, I began creating a series of applications using the Lightning Web Component (LWC) framework.
                        In my spare time, I remain committed to continuously honing my HTML/CSS and JavaScript skills, with the ultimate goal of developing and launching fully custom websites and web applications. My diverse background, technical acumen, and relentless drive for self-improvement position me as a dedicated and adaptable front-end developer, ready to bring innovative solutions and creative ideas to your team.</p>
