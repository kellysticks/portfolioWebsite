                    <div class="white-box">
                        <p>I began my professional journey in Technology Consulting, initially serving as a Scrum Master and Functional Analyst. 
                            My responsibilities included traditional functional and product tasks, such as facilitating grooming sessions, developing and refining user stories, establishing acceptance criteria, and overseeing my Scrum team. During this period, 
                            I discovered that my true passion lay in hands-on development rather than just supervising it. 
                            This revelation prompted me to dedicate the next three years of my career to mastering the intricate technical aspects of the SaaS/PaaS Salesforce platform.</p>
                            <p> <a href="#" class="readMore"> Read More </a> </p>
                        <div class="hidden">
                            <p>I pursued multiple Salesforce certifications and transitioned into the role of a Salesforce System Administrator. This role provided me with an in-depth understanding of Salesforce. 
                            However, I often found myself more drawn to and interested in developing 'custom' Salesforce solutions rather than relying solely on the platform's out-of-the-box (OOTB) capabilities. 
                            I received educational training in Java, Python, and C#, which aligned with my interests, but it still took me some time to realize that I wanted to code full time. 
                            Once I had this epiphany, I decided to further enhance my technical capabilities and become a full-fledged Front-End Web Developer. Leveraging my expertise in Salesforce and experience in delivering Salesforce implementations, I began creating applications using the Lightning Web Component (LWC) framework.</p>
                        <p> In my spare time, I remain committed to continuously honing my HTML/CSS and JavaScript skills, with the ultimate goal of developing and launching fully custom websites and web applications. 
                            My diverse background, technical acumen, and relentless drive for self-improvement position me as a dedicated and adaptable front-end developer, ready to bring innovative solutions and creative ideas to a team.</p>
